					<li data-theme="b">How does Othello's final speech before he dies characterize him?</li>
					<li data-theme="d">As a final speech from the plays protagonist one would expect it to be respectable or perhaps inspiring, however Othello does not seem to nail this.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Instead he spends much of it making statements that seem very false, such as commenting that he is not made jealous easily, which by looking at the fact that he murders his wife because he believed lies about her infidelity, one could argue that he is made very jealous easily.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Following this Othello then goes on to brag about his military accomplishments and seems to put too much emphasis on his military legacy than one should near the moment of death.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">It seems as if his military and political reputation is far more important than anything else to him.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">However despite his boasting and misguided beliefs his final speech does still prove quite powerful to the other characters as well as the audience.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">For the first time in a while Othello appears to be the same strong spoken and powerful man as he was early on the play.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">He is even able to convince the others that his suicide is very noble and heroic, which is a feat in and of itself.</li>
				</ul>
				<ul data-role="listview" data-inset="true">
					<li data-theme="b">What role does Desdemona play and how does the role change in different contexts?</li>
					<li data-theme="d">At the end of the play Desdemona seems as passive of a character as possible as she is smothered to death by Othello, a fate she almost seemingly accepts despite her innocence.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">However before the final scenes Desdemona proves that she is more than just the passive wife of Othello.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Early on in the play she shows she is a very assertive woman when she gives an inspired speech about her love and marriage with Othello.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">This speech is even more impressive as she is the only female character present on stage and is surrounded by many powerful men.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">She often shows that she will stand up for what she believes is right in her defense of Cassio, despite causing more trouble for herself as Othello sees this as evidence that she is truly unfaithful.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Despite being quite powerful for a women of her time period, she does show some weakness as she cannot seem to truly stand up to Othello and defend herself.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">She cannot even bring herself to badmouth her ruthless husband even in the company of those she trusts.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">In the end her submissiveness to Othello's abuse makes her an easy target when he kills her.</li>
