					<li data-theme="d">Othello is a dedicated and valuable soldier in Venice, he is also well respected</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Being older and newly married, he has spent much of his life focused on being a military man as opposed a husband</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Though he loves his wife Desdemona very much his military roles will always come first</li>
					<li data-theme="c">This proves to be a problem as the play wears on however, as Othello is summoned to Cyprus on military matters and choses to bring Desdemona along with him</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Othello had originally wooed Desdemona with his tales of military heroism as it gave him great confidence</li>
					<li data-theme="c">However once in Cyprus with seemingly no military duties to take care of his confidence begins to wane</li>
					<li data-theme="d">He fears of losing his wife which ultimately makes him vulnerable to Iago's deception</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Iago is able to get under Othello's skin and convince him his wife is unfaithful</li>
					<li data-theme="d">The powerful military man does not like to not have control in a situation, and the lack of control in his wife's alleged affair leads him to seemingly crack</li>
					<li data-theme="c">He cannot separate the two lives from each other and therefore he is subject to downfall</li>

					<li data-theme="b">The Danger of Isolation</li>
					<li data-theme="d">As the play shifts from the large city of Venice to the smaller island town of Cyprus the plot thickens</li>
					<li data-theme="c">The new setting is a very isolated as it is a small island with strong fortifications</li>
					<li data-theme="d">On this island the main characters are in close proximity very often however they each desire their own individual isolation</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Iago often speaks to the audience in soliloquies</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Roderigo is only connected to Iago and therefore is isolated from the other characters</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Othello seeks to be alone in contemplation at times as he contemplates his wife's alleged infidelity</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Each character desires their isolation, yet due to the setting it is not so hard to come by</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Therefore the unfavorable setting that isolates the characters from society, however not providing them with the isolation they needs is a recipe for disaster</li>
